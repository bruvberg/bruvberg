    <p>B. RILEY
Street Recommendations
Friday, August 30, 2024
RDW B. Riley upgraded Redwire to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $8. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade with the shares down 26% decline since its downgrade on July 21. The selloff is due to valuation concerns as well as reaction to a string of open market sales by controlling owner AE Industrial Partners, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Riley believes Redwire &ldquo;remains entrenched on a shortlist of winners in the new space economy, fueled by a strong portfolio of proprietary products and services that are enabling the next generation of space exploration and habitation.&rdquo;
BARCLAYS
VSCO Barclays raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Victoria&rsquo;s Secret to $23 from $19 and keeps an Underweight rating on the shares. The company reported Q2 results that beat on earnings, driven by spending leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says Victoria&rsquo;s turnaround is challenged by a weakening consumer.
AFRM Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Affirm to $50 from $41 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst updated the company&rsquo;s model post the Q4 report.
AEO Barclays lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on American Eagle to $26 from $32 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 sales missed as comp growth sequentially moderated, partially due to weakness in July, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the stock&rsquo;s risk/reward is attractive despite the uncertain macro environment.
ADSK Barclays raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $310 from $275 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company raised guidance for billings and revenue, partially from the new transaction model, but also raised earnings and free cash flow guidance, which are not impacted by the new model, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the company&rsquo;s normalized margins are reaching targets one year earlier.
BBY Barclays analyst Seth Sigman raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Best Buy to $95 from $81 and keeps an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s strong Q2 results reflect improving industry trends, product innovation, and effective expense management, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
MRVL Barclays analyst Tom O&rsquo;Malley raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Marvell to $85 from $80 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst says the company is &ldquo;firing on all cylinders.&rdquo; Marvell&rsquo;s AI Optical and Custom ASIC ramps are both expected to exceed prior targets, intersecting a core business recovery that looks to finally be underway, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
ULTA Barclays raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $335 from $328 and keeps an Equal Weight rating on the shares post the Q2 report. Ulta lowered its fiscal 2024 guidance for all metrics as it expects sales to be pressured as the beauty category normalizes and competition intensifies, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
BERNSTEIN
LULU Bernstein lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Lululemon to $325 from $345 and keeps a Market Perform rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 report featured a sales miss &ldquo;salvaged by strong margins,&rdquo; and management&rsquo;s tone changing &ldquo;from denial to constructive commentary on what went wrong and how they are fixing it,&rdquo; the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm is &ldquo;incrementally more positive,&rdquo; seeing Lululemon as a &ldquo;brand in repair that can be fixed.&rdquo;
DELL Bernstein lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Dell Technologies to $140 from $155 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 results were solid with the beat entirely due to artificial intelligence servers, as storage and PC revenues both came in below consensus, the analyst tells investors in a research note. However, the firm struggles with Dell&rsquo;s guidance &ldquo;on two fronts.&rdquo; The AI server revenue guidance appears very conservative, but deliveries can be lumpy, and the fiscal 2025 earnings guidance &ldquo;points to a very steep sequential ramp&rdquo; in ISG profitability in Q4, &ldquo;which is not a slam dunk,&rdquo; contends Bernstein.
CRWD Bernstein analyst Peter Weed raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Crowdstrike to $334 from $315 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares post the Q2 report. The firm thinks the the worst of the global IT outage impact may be over by early next year. Slipped deals still appeared on track to close, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
MDB Bernstein raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $360 from $358 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. MongoDB delivered a good quarter and solid Q3 guidance, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says that given all the concerns this year around the macro and demand environment for software and MongoDB&rsquo;s results last quarter, this quarter&rsquo;s results and guidance &ldquo;shine through.&rdquo;
PSNY Bernstein raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Polestar to 78c from 74c and keeps an Underperform rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 results came in slightly better than expected, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the tariff delays make it more optimistic. However, Polestar&rsquo;s double-digit gross margins &ldquo;remain a stretch,&rdquo; it adds.
BMO CAPITAL
CM BMO Capital analyst Sohrab Movahedi raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on CIBC to C$81 from C$77 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares.
BOFA
CM BofA upgraded CIBC (CM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of C$90, up from C$74. The analyst has increasing confidence around the bank&rsquo;s earnings and return on equity outlook. CIBC&rsquo;s steady execution has the potential to improve investor perception, which should allow the stock to narrow the relative valuation gap versus &ldquo;best-in-class peer&rdquo; Royal Bank of Canada (RY), the analyst tells investors in a research note. In addition, the potential for the Canadian economy to stage a rebound next year also increases confidence in adding exposure to the stock, says BofA.
DELL BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Dell Technologies to $155 from $150 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported Q2 results and the FY25 revenue guidance mid-point was raised $1.5B. While Q2 EPS beat the Street by 18c, Q3 EPS was guided 17c below the Street view and FY25 EPS guidance was raised by 15c at the mid-point, the analyst noted. BofA reiterates a Buy as it is still in the early stages of AI adoption, it sees margin growth over time on better mix, and sees tailwind from the upcoming PC refresh cycle and longer-term AI PC adoption.
MDB BofA analyst Brad Sills raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $350 from $300 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s &ldquo;solid&rdquo; Q2 results suggest that the issues that drove the lower FY25 outlook last quarter are perhaps subsiding, says the analyst, who raised the firm&rsquo;s FY25 revenue view. The firm believes MongoDB is on a path to accelerate back to mid-30s Atlas revenue growth, which it says would be a catalyst for the shares over the coming quarters.
LULU BofA lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Lululemon to $355 from $440 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Lululemon reported Q2 EPS of $3.15, beating the firm&rsquo;s $2.96 estimate, but revenue increased 7%, below guidance due to continued product issues, and management lowered its F24 sales growth view to 8%-9%, or 6-7% excluding the 53rd week, which incorporates similar trends in the second half as Q2, the analyst noted. The firm is lowering its FY24 EPS by 27c to $14.00 to reflect slower second half sales growth and reducing its price target to reflect the lower growth profile.
ULTA BofA lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $380 from $425 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. Management cut FY24 guidance &ldquo;across the board&rdquo; and is now expecting comps down 2% to flat and EPS of $22.60- 23.50, versus $25.20-26.00 previously, notes the analyst, who is lowering the firm&rsquo;s FY24 and FY25 EPS estimates by 11% and 13% to $23.09 and $24.44, respectively, on lower comps and associated margin deleverage.
ESTC BofA downgraded Elastic to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $94, down from $140. Risks are now elevated from disruption in the sales organization due to issues experienced during a strategic sales realignment, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm still believes that Elastic is disruptive and a long-term share gainer in gen-AI, search, observability, and security, but it argues that rightsizing sales execution missteps can take several quarters and views the the risk/reward as balanced until data shows that &ldquo;the issues are firmly behind.&rdquo;
VSCO BofA raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Victoria&rsquo;s Secret to $21 from $18 and keeps an Underperform rating on the shares. The firm is raising its FY25 EPS estimate by 5% to $2.05 to reflect stronger sales, but maintains an Underperform rating based on continued sales and margin pressure.
ATAT BofA analyst Ronald Leung raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Atour Lifestyle to $25.20 from $23.50 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company reported a Q2 beat, raised fiscal year revenue guidance and announced a three-year dividend policy of not less than 50% payout. The firm, which raised its FY24 adjusted net income view by 10% on higher-than-expected hotel openings, believes the beat and the dividend are &ldquo;not entirely unexpected,&rdquo; but adds that &ldquo;a decent result in a tough market is still welcomed by the market.&rdquo;
PAHC BofA raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Phibro Animal Health to $15 from $13 and keeps an Underperform rating on the shares. Phibro ended FY24 on a strong note and its initial FY25 outlook &ldquo;suggests this is set to continue,&rdquo; says the firm as it updates estimates and rolls forward its valuation. However, BofA keeps an Underperform rating given what it identifies as Phibro&rsquo;s &ldquo;still sub-peer growth and margin profiles,&rdquo; largely due to product mix.
LMT BofA notes Lockheed Martin secured three &ldquo;significant contract awards&rdquo; totaling $5.1B aimed at enhancing F-35 sustainment and driving continued engineering advancements, stating that these awards &ldquo;underscore robust demand for the F-35 program and the growing tailwinds for sustainment efforts.&rdquo; The firm, which sees the F-35 as a &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of the recent pause on Next-Generation Air Dominance development program and views the restart of F-35 deliveries with Tech Refresh-3 packages as &ldquo;a major milestone,&rdquo; maintains a Buy rating and $635 price target on Lockheed shares.
BURL BofA raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Burlington Stores to $315 from $275 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm, which is raising its EPS estimates after &ldquo;a strong 2Q beat driven by higher sales,&rdquo; views the second half outlook for flat to up 2% comps and waning gross margin expansion as conservative, the analyst tells investors in a post-earnings note.
BTIG
CANACCORD
ULTA Canaccord lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $442 from $500 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm said the Q2 top line missed has led to adjusted earnings fro the year to come down with management citing normalizing beauty demand, increased competition, operational hiccups with the ERP implementation, and certain promos not driving the boost in sales as expected.
CANTOR FITZGERALD
DDD Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Troy Jensen lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on 3D Systems to $3.75 from $5.50 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. As largely expected, 3D filed its delayed financials for the quarters ending March 31 and June 30, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says that for the first half of 2024, the company&rsquo;s consolidated revenue declined 13% year-over-year on lower printer sales, partially offset by growth in services with flat materials sales. In industrial, 3D saw growth in aerospace and defense and semiconductors, and the pipeline in those end markets remains healthy, adds Cantor.
SSYS Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Stratasys to $12 from $23 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 was challenging, as it continued to experience macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds that negatively impacted customer capital equipment purchasing and hardware sales, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm reduced estimates to reflect continued macroeconomic headwinds impacting customer capital equipment purchases.
PSNY Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard says shares of Polestar rose 13% after a new CEO was announced along with $300M in external funding. While surprised about Thomas Ingenlath&rsquo;s departure, the firm continues to believe Polestar benefits from the support of Volvo and Geely, and manufacturing in China. Cantor expects Polestar&rsquo;s delivery volume and margin progression to improve materially in the second half of 2024. It keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $3 price target.
CITI
CLSA
BZUN CLSA downgraded Baozun to Hold from Outperform with a price target of $2.20, down from $2.80, post the Q2 report. The weak macro environment and &ldquo;intense&rdquo; competition are still weighing on the company&rsquo;s profits, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes small e-commerce players like Baozun &ldquo;are more vulnerable amid fierce competition.&rdquo;
CORMARK
CM Cormark analyst Lemar Persaud upgraded CIBC to Buy from Market Perform with an C$83 price target. DA DAVIDSON
FLWS DA Davidson upgraded 1-800-Flowers.com to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $7, down from $8. The company reported a Q4 miss and guided to FY25 EBITDA ($85M-$95M), below consensus at ($99.4M), and given the continuing low consumer sentiment, the firm thinks there&rsquo;s risk of a further push-out of an expected return to positive sales growth, the analyst tells investors. However, year-over-year sales change is likely to be less negative in Q1 and the firm thinks Street estimates are &ldquo;now adequately de-risked in the near-term,&rdquo; prompting the upgrade of shares following the stock&rsquo;s 28% decline since mid-July.
DEUTSCHE BANK
GMAB Deutsche Bank lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Genmab to DKK 2,500 from DKK 2,750 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares.
HSBC
CRWD HSBC upgraded Crowdstrike to Buy from Hold with a price target of $339, up from $302. The firm says that with the financial impact of the July 19 global IT outage incident &ldquo;now known, we think that the bad news is behind us.&rdquo; While CrowdStrike lowered its guidance, it still implies a strong sales growth of 23% year-over-year in the next two quarters, almost twice the expected growth rates of other security companies, the analyst tells investors in a research note. HSBC thinks Crowdstrike&rsquo;s long-term growth prospects remain intact. The company has exposure to some of the fastest growing markets in the security industry and its native-artificial intelligence design gives it a structural competitive advantage, the firm contends.
JEFFERIES
ESTC Jefferies analyst Brent Thill lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $110 from $140 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance by $34M at the midpoint due to a previously unknown significant sales realignment and execution issues in fiscal Q1, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says Elastic&rsquo;s credibility in the near-term will take a hit given this lack of communication. However, this is purely execution related, not fundamental and competitive issues, contends Jefferies. With the stock 25% post the results, the firm sees an attractive &ldquo;de-risked setup.&rdquo;
YPF Jefferies analyst Alejandro Anibal Demichelis upgraded YPF to Buy from Hold with a price target of $30, up from $23.50. While YPF has performed well year-to-date, the market still underappreciates the company&rsquo;s scope to boost upstream profitability, accelerate Vaca Muerta shale output and unlock hidden value from subsidiaries YPF Luz and Profertil, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says grow. YPF&rsquo;s &ldquo;so called 4x4 transformation plan is gathering pace.&rdquo;
JPMORGAN
BMA JPMorgan upgraded Banco Macro to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $78, up from $14. After several years of a more cautious view on Argentine banks, the firm is revising its ratings to recognize the macro and micro improvements. While uncertainty remains high and Argentina remains a &ldquo;binary story,&rdquo; making it premature to become overly optimistic, the banks should continue to see a re-rating &ldquo;if things keep moving in the right direction,&rdquo; the analyst tells investors in a research note. Macro has more capital but historically was more defensive due to its exposure to government employees, making it a better player for securities as it has excess liquidity and capital, contends JPMorgan.
BBY JPMorgan raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Best Buy to $111 from $101 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst says the company&rsquo;s comp progression and margin upside &ldquo;open a path to continued re-rating&rdquo; of the shares. Best Buy&rsquo;s Q2 comps better than expected, led by innovation in computing and tablets, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
OLLI JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ollie&rsquo;s Bargain Outlet to $105 from $113 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares post the Q2 report. The firm says management continues to remain prudent in store growth planning. In the near-term, the analyst sees a strong closeout deal backdrop, an improving competitive backdrop, and consistent execution supporting same-store-sales growth for Ollie&rsquo;s.
DG JPMorgan lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Dollar General to $97 from $130 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The company reported a Q2 miss and guidance cut, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says that while management is citing progress on the &ldquo;Back To Basics&rdquo; stratagy, the consumer remains increasingly focused on value and convenience. While Dollar General hasn&rsquo;t seen a &ldquo;deterioration&rdquo; in share, it is not seeing as strong of a pick-up from available share as it did in Q1, contends JPMorgan.
LOOP CAPITAL
DG Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Dollar General to $90 from $130 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 results were worse than expected and the management&rsquo;s guidance cut was &ldquo;surprising&rdquo;, the analyst tells investors in a research note. This &ldquo;miss and lower&rdquo; throws cold water on any expectation that CEO Todd Vasos&rsquo;s return would result in a quick turnaround, the firm added.
BBY Loop Capital raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Best Buy to $110 from $100 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company&rsquo;s Q2 earnings beat was highlighted by a significant comparable sales acceleration despite a much tougher prior-year comparison, gross margin expansion, and tight expense management, the analyst tells investors in a research note. It was also encouraging to see the management increase its FY24 earnings guidance despite a slight reduction in its top-line forecast, which could prove conservative given the recent and upcoming introductions of AI- optimized PCs and smartphones, the firm added..
BURL Loop Capital raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Burlington Stores to $345 from $270 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst cites the company&rsquo;s better than expected Q2 results with a 60bps outperformance in gross margins and the management&rsquo;s &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; guidance raise. The firm is also positive on Burlington Stores accelerating market share gains due to department store closures and their decreasing relevancy.
MIZUHO
ADSK Mizuho raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $260 from $230 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The company reported solid Q2 results and raised key 2025 guidance metrics including revenue, earnings, and free cash flow midpoint targets, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says Autodesk&rsquo;s new transaction model roll-out in North America is &ldquo;progressing smoothly&rdquo; with plans to launch in Europe in September, ahead of the earlier fiscal 2026 plan.
MDB Mizuho raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $275 from $250 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. After the Q1 &ldquo;hiccup,&rdquo; MongoDB delivered Q2 revenue and margins ahead of consensus, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the company benefited from strong new workload acquisitions and slightly better than expected Atlas consumption trends despite the tough macro backdrop.
MORGAN STANLEY
DG Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman downgraded Dollar General (DG) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $100, down from $170. The company&rsquo;s sales are pressured by a weaker low-income consumer while its margin recovery path is pushed out, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says share gain or food inflation for Dollar General seem unlikely to support comps in the near-term. It says the company needs to comp 3% to lever expenses. However, Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) are taking significant amounts of share, &ldquo;leaving crumbs for everyone else,&rdquo; contends Morgan Stanley.
LULU Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Lululemon to $326 from $329 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The positive after-market share reaction on the back of the company&rsquo;s Q2 topline miss and fiscal year guidance reduction confirms the low bar and bearish sentiment heading into the print, as well as the possibility that the market has potentially assigned a floor to Lululemon&rsquo;s valuation, the analyst tells investors.
MRVL Morgan Stanley raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Marvell to $82 from $77 and keeps an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Even while calling themselves &ldquo;curmudgeons on valuation (in part due to high stock comp),&rdquo; Morgan Stanley argues that the after hours move &ldquo;seems justified&rdquo; as nearly every business has turned the corner. In addition, management seems very bullish and there is significant operating leverage as revenue growth persists, the firm says.
VSCO Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Victoria&rsquo;s Secret to $23 from $20 and keeps an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The Q2 beat and fiscal year guidance raise were &ldquo;mostly as expected&rdquo; following the company&rsquo;s pre-announcement and confirm Q2 upside was &ldquo;lower-quality,&rdquo; the analyst tells investors. The firm&rsquo;s view is unchanged that FY24 guidance is &ldquo;likely fair,&rdquo; but its ongoing skepticism on the longer-term turnaround achievability remains, the analyst added.
ADSK Morgan Stanley raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $320 from $305 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Autodesk outperformed on revenues in Q2 and the results reflected durability in demand, says the analyst. Shares trading at about a 15% discount to peers, plus a catalyst path for improved demand, margin and/or investor sentiment &ldquo;frames a favorable risk/reward,&rdquo; the analyst tells investors.
MDB Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $340 from $320 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Q2 results, supported by an improvement in usage trends and better sales execution, were &ldquo;encouraging,&rdquo; says the analyst, who acknowledges near-term growth will &ldquo;still be sub-standard,&rdquo; but sees multiple catalysts for growth to improve in FY26. The firm views Q2 as &ldquo;the first step in a multi-quarter journey to get back to more attractive growth,&rdquo; the analyst added.
OPPENHEIMER
ADSK Oppenheimer raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $300 from $275 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company reported Q2 results ahead of consensus with strength surfacing across regions, and product lines in both AEC and manufacturing, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says that while billings fell below Street expectations due to more coterminous contracts, the full-year outlook was increased and the overall dynamics &ldquo;still net out positive.&rdquo; It believes Autodesk &ldquo;sprinkled in enough breadcrumbs to advance the profitability narrative.&rdquo;
ULTA Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $435 from $450 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company reported softer Q2 results and guided slightly below the firm&rsquo;s expectations, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm continues to view Ulta shares as appropriate for longer-term players and would take advantage of any dips from here.
ESTC Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $125 from $150 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company reported disappointing Q1 results, largely behind a poorly managed sales segmentation change that drove weaker GTM execution and lower contracted commitments, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm added that it is taking a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach, looking for noticeable improvement before reconsidering its rating.
MDB Oppenheimer raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $350 from $300 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company delivered a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; Q2, beating consensus estimates and raising Q3 and FY25 guidance ahead of consensus expectations, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm said that, overall, it came away positive, seeing a reasonably set near-term bar and attractive long-term opportunity.
PIPER SANDLER
PRI Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Primerica with a Neutral rating and $283 price target. The analyst believes the shares are fairly valued but says Primerica &ldquo;has a clearly defined niche and well-developed moat leading to an above average return profile.&rdquo; The company&rsquo;s valuation could benefit from investors valuing more under a distribution framework, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
MDB Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $335 from $300 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The solid beat-and-raise suggest the worst of a two-year growth moderation is now behind MongoDB, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm added that Q2 top-line growth of 13% could mark a near-term quarterly trough setting up for accelerating growth into next year.
LULU Piper Sandler raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Lululemon to $260 from $250 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. With its quarterly beat, Lululemon is shaving 32c out of Q4, which the firm thinks may not be enough considering that inventories are now on the rise and better balance with newness/core in women&rsquo;s not expected until Spring 2025, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
ADSK Piper Sandler analyst Clarke Jeffries raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $257 from $239 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm noted that, with the FY25 revenue and billings guidance raised, it assumes the higher outlookd does not include any significant net organic raise. More importantly, the analyst says, was the company&rsquo;s comments that ex-the transaction model and FX, the company would hit 38%-40% non-GAAP operating margins this year.
BBY Piper Sandler analyst Peter Keith raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Best Buy to $114 from $100 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While the Q2 comp remained negative and the second half comp was guided down, yesterday&rsquo;s share performance was likely driven by the company&rsquo;s impressive EBIT margin expansion and better than expected sales, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm added that labor is getting managed very efficiently, and Best Buy is seeing healthy gross margin expansion from refining its Services offering.
ULTA Piper Sandler lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $356 from $404 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm said it remains on the sidelines with Ulta following a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; Q2 and guidance reduction due primarily to ongoing competitive pressures and deleverage in the P&amp;L. Where the firm is most focused now is what this means for FY25 and expectations to be laid out at management&rsquo;s upcoming analyst day, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
PIVOTAL RESEARCH
NFLX Pivotal Research raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Netflix to $900 from $800 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm says it is raising its already Street-high price target driven by a move to a year-end 2025 target from 2024 previously and an increase in its medium- and long-term global subscriber forecasts to 384M by 2023 versus 370M previously. The higher subscriber forecast reflects on-going strong business momentum and a still relatively small share of the ultimate global opportunity, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Netflix is &ldquo;clearly the dominant paid global streaming player for the foreseeable future,&rdquo; the analyst tells investors in a research note.
RAYMOND JAMES

RBC CAPITAL
OLLI RBC Capital analyst Steven Shemesh lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ollie&rsquo;s Bargain Outlet to $100 from $101 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares after its Q2 results and guidance. The company comp momentum, but given the current valuation, investor reservation approach a major competitor liquidation that has significant overlap with Ollie&rsquo;s footprint is understandable, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Tracking intraquarter comp trends around competitor liquidations sales will be key to tactical positioning, the firm added.
ROSENBLATT
MRVL Rosenblatt raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Marvell to $120 from $100 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported a modest beat for the July quarter and a &ldquo;reasonably big outlook beat&rdquo; for the October quarter, fueled by artificial intelligence momentum and a recovery in enterprise networking and carrier, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
ADSK Rosenblatt raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $295 from $290 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the Q2 report. The company noted a smooth launch of its direct customer billing transaction model in the key North American market in June, and plans launches in Western Europe in September and Japan in November, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says that with a stable environment in Q2 and the direct billing program progressing, Autodesk increased its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance.
ESTC Rosenblatt lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $120 from $136 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. While the fiscal Q1 headline numbers were positive, Elastic&rsquo;s overall volume of customer commitments fell short late in the quarter due to disruptions the company introduced through changes in sales segmentation, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
SCOTIABANK
CM Scotiabank raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on CIBC to C$85 from C$77 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares.
ESTC Scotiabank lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $92 from $135 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares.
STIFEL
ADSK Stifel analyst Adam Borg raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Autodesk to $320 from $290 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company delivered &ldquo;a healthy F2Q print, with most key metrics above guidance and/or Stifel/street estimates.&rdquo; Given the pressure from Starboard, Autodesk highlighted the organic, ex-transactional model, margin expansion it has been delivering, which is expected to continue, and the company is also ramping share buybacks, notes the analyst, who says the &ldquo;bottom line is Autodesk is executing well despite the mixed macro.&rdquo;
ESTC Stifel lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $98 from $120 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Elastic posted a &ldquo;modest&rdquo; Q1 top- and bottom-line beat, but sales execution issues overshadowed these results as poor execution post account reallocation caused management to meaningfully lower FY25 top-line expectations by $34M, or 2.7%, the analyst tells investors. While the sales execution issues likely take a few quarters to rectify, the firm believes the potential for greater near-term profitability, coupled with a relatively attractive valuation, &ldquo;positions the stock for some level of modest rebound in future quarters.&rdquo;
GEF Stifel lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Greif to $85 from $88 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Greif continues to see mixed levels of recovery in end markets, geographies and substrates as overall volumes are still down double-digits from normal historical levels, says the analyst. The midpoint of FY24 AEBITDA guidance of $700M can be reached with pricing actions already in place and without any additional volume recovery, but a full recovery back to 2022 volumes would push FY25 AEBITDA over $900M, the analyst estimates.
MRVL Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Marvell to $95 from $90 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm remains &ldquo;impressed&rdquo; with Marvell&rsquo;s execution within the DC/AI space, even as the company&rsquo;s other end markets resume sequential growth, says the analyst, who maintains the stock as a &ldquo;Select List&rdquo; pick.
MDB Stifel raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on MongoDB to $325 from $300 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following what the firm calls &ldquo;a solid rebound quarter.&rdquo; A 3% revenue beat was driven by consumption growth that modestly outperformed expectations and solid improvement in new business execution across EA and Atlas, adds the analyst, who believes the results highlight improving execution in the challenged macro environment.
ULTA Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $385 from $475 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. Ulta reported &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; Q2 results with comp and EBIT below consensus while reducing full-year guidance across key metrics, notes the analyst, who says share loss and moderating beauty category growth are &ldquo;not a good combo.&rdquo;
TD COWEN
KSS TD Cowen last night downgraded Kohl&rsquo;s to Hold from Buy with a price target of $21, down from $25. Despite initiatives in new and underpenetrated categories, the company&rsquo;s comp has stayed negative for the past 10 quarters given challenges in apparel and footwear, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the stock&rsquo;s valuation at &ldquo;appears fair&rdquo; and the shares could be rangebound pending visibility on sustainable growth. Challenges in Kohl&rsquo;s core apparel and footwear business and middle income consumer pressure will likely persist, impacting basket and promotions in the second half of 2024.
LULU TD Cowen raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Lululemon to $382 from $375 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm said they poosted a Q2 sales miss but EPS upside was driven by gross margin, with EBIT dollars +13% year- over-year. The results and tempered 2H guidance speak to the durability of the financial model in the face of a slowdown in the U.S. business.
BURL TD Cowen raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Burlington Stores to $288 from $279 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm said Q2 results were impressive on both SSS, Gross Margin and SG&amp;A leverage. Cowen views the 2H guidance as conservative.
ULTA TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Ulta Beauty to $395 from $500 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The firm said investor concerns remain including a decelerating category heightened promos and competition and a value-seeking customer. Comps declined on weaker transactions which offset higher tickets driven by prestige makeup and haircare.
AEO TD Cowen lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on American Eagle to $23 from $25 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. The firm said Q2 EPS was largely in line with Street but their take is that sales from swimwear and intimates at Aerie were weaker than expected and Men&rsquo;s at American Eagle underperformed Women&rsquo;s which limited upside to the quarter.
ESTC TD Cowen lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $80 from $110 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. The firm beleives the GTM issues were the big surprise, and were the bulk of the reason for the guide cut. These changes included adding more reps on strategic accounts, increasing focus on enterprise accounts (reducing the number of accounts per rep), and assigning reps to target net new logos. While Cowen thinks these are fixable issues, they will take time to work through.
DELL TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar raised the firm&rsquo;s price target on Dell Technologies to $218 from $155 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. The firm said the raised FY25 outlook was a key positive, but the October quarter guide for server demand to be down and flat AI server backlog of $3.8B, could temper near-term sentiment.
TELSEY ADVISORY
DG Telsey Advisory analyst Joseph Feldman downgraded Dollar General (DG) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $103, down from $168. Challenging macro environments for consumers historically resulted in strong performance for Dollar General and other value-priced retailers, but this phenomenon is not playing out during this cycle, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says middle-income and slightly more affluent households have not been trading down into Dollar General, as they did in previous times of higher financial duress. Telsey thinks the more affluent customers are increasing their spending at Walmart (WMT) and other discounters instead.

Oneok (OKE) is buying GIP&rsquo;s controlling stake in EnLink and 100% of Medallion Midstream in a transaction as a positive for both Oneok and EnLink Midstream, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

ESTC Wells Fargo lowered the firm&rsquo;s price target on Elastic to $100 from $145 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Shares of the company were down 25% after market due to a lowered outlook for FY25, as management underestimated the impact from sales changes made in the quarter, the analyst tells investors in a research note.
